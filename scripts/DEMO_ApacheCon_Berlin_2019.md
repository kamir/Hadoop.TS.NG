# Time Series generartion with KStreams 
 
A time series is an ordered set of time stamped observations. 
We create such time series objects (TSOs) from individual events 
 which are collected in a KStreams application. 

The stream is chunked into session windows. We repeat the TSO generation
procedure for earch window:

+ group events by metric
+ sort events per group by time stamp
+ populate the TSO object 
+ convert TSO object into JSON

 
## Demo Procedure

First, we start teh event-aggregation streaming application:

```
cd opentsx-kstreams
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.semanpix.kstreams.StateStoreExample4"
```

Next, we run the data generation process: 
```
cd opentsx-core
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.opentsx.tsa.rng.RNGReferenceDSCreator"
```

Finally, we compare results taken from Cassandra time series bucket store
with result generated by our event-aggregator.

```
cd opentsx-core
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.opentsx.tsa.rng.RNGRefernceDSLoader"
```
