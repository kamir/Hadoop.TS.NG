Hadoop.TS 
=========

The project provides a collection of tools, which implement algorithms for time series statistics. 
With this components one can build scalable time-series processing applications on top
of Apache Hadoop where data is stored in HDFS or in Apache HBase.

It contains a set of simple generic classes to represent and transform complex data structures, organized 
in Buckets or as individual events like in OpenTSDB.

The core components are: TimeSeries, TSBuckets and TSProcessors. Several submodules contain implementations
of specific algorithms for univariate or bivariate time series analysis, especially for applications in
complex systems research.

A major aspect of Hadoop.TS is to enable rapid prototyping for new algorithms based on existing
preprocessed data, which is collected and stored in Hadoop clusters. Deployment and development 
cycles are short, because all implemented algorithms will come with demo applications, e.g:
- extraction of time series data from logfiles like Wikipedia click count data 
- connection to intermediate data sources like Nutch crawl results or Lucene index files.
- conversion between time series and inter-event-time time-series.
- generating of standard output for network analysis tools like Gephi, or networkx
- integration into Mahout libraries, based on data which is stored in SequenceFiles, which are readable for Mahout

In this sense Hadoop.TS serves as a 'large-scale glueware' for existing resources. As it is Hadoop-based, 
the Hadoop.TS project benefits from all of Hadoops's nice features like fault-tolerance and scalability.
