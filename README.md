#Hadoop.TS.NG
============

This project provides a collection of tools and algorithms for advanced time series 
statistics on Apache Spark including GPU support (JCuda). 

We build scalable time-series processing applications on top of Apache Hadoop where 
data is stored in HBase (via OpenTSDB), or in HDFS.

The framework contains a set of generic classes to represent and transform 
complex data structures. It offers features for management of time series buckets. 

Besides OpenTSDB also other sources for time series are supported: e.g., Yahoo! Financial 
services for stock market data and Cloudera Manager for operational data generated by Hadoop clusters. 

The essential core components are: TimeSeries, TSBuckets and TSProcessors. 

Several submodules contain implementations of specific algorithms for univariate and 
bivariate time series analysis. Such algorithms are especially useful for for applications in complex systems research.

A major aspect of Hadoop.TS.NG is to enable rapid prototyping for new algorithms based on existing
preprocessed data, which is collected and stored in Hadoop clusters. 

Deployment and development cycles are shortened, because all implemented algorithms will come with demo applications, e.g:
- extraction of time series data from logfiles like Wikipedia click count data 
- connection to intermediate data sources like Nutch crawl results or Lucene index files.
- conversion between time series and inter-event-time time-series.
- generating of standard output for network analysis tools like Gephi, or networkx
- integration into Mahout libraries, based on data which is stored in SequenceFiles, which are readable for Mahout

In this sense Hadoop.TS.NG serves as a 'large-scale glueware' for existing resources, 
such as algorithms developed for information dynamics. 

As it is Spark-based, the Hadoop.TS project benefits from all of Hadoops's and Spark's 
nice features like fault-tolerance and scalability.
