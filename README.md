# OpenTSx

OpenTSx is a library and a collection of tools for cloud native time series analysis projects.  
The project provides a collection of data models and algorithms for advanced time series statistics.
The initial focus has been on Apache Spark as the central processing framework. 

The renaming of the project from Hadoop.TS.NG to OpenTSx goes with a shift of the project focus. Instead 
of building an application based on Appache Spark we create components to be used in data pipelines and
in batch mode no matter which storage technology is used.

Our current focus is Apache Kafka Streams for stream processing, Apache Spark for batch processing, and 
Apache Cassandra for long term persistence of time series data. Apache Solr is used as metadata store, together 
with Apache Jena or Neo4J which both can expose the querieable knowledge graph.

## History
In the first phase of the project, we built scalable time-series processing applications on top of 
Apache Hadoop where data has been stored in HBase (via OpenTSDB), or in HDFS.

The framework contains a set of generic classes to represent and transform 
complex data structures. It offers features for management of time series buckets. The concept named TimeSeriesBucket
has evolved into a CompoundDataSet which can be persisted in cloud services using multiple technologies behind
one single abstraction. 

Besides OpenTSDB, many other API based sources can provide time series for a time series bucket, e.g., 
Yahoo! Financial services for stock market, ElasticSearch and Apache Solr for collected log data, or even 
Cloudera Manager for operational data generated by the Cloudera data platform (CDP). 

The essential core components are: TimeSeries, TSBuckets and TSProcessors. 

Several submodules contain implementations of specific algorithms for univariate and 
bivariate time series analysis. Such algorithms are especially useful for for applications in complex systems research.

The major aspect of OpenTSx is to enable rapid prototyping for new algorithms based on existing
preprocessed data, which is collected and stored in the cloud or local systems. 

Deployment and development cycles are shortened, because all implemented algorithms will come with demo applications, e.g:
- extraction of time series data from logfiles like Wikipedia click count data 
- conversion between time series and inter-event-time time-series.
- generating of standard output for network analysis tools like Gephi, networkx, or Neo4J
- integration with ML libraries such as TensorFlow and Deeplearning4J.

In this sense OpenTSx serves as a 'glueware' to combine already existing resources. Another example is the 
integration of algorithms developed for information dynamics. 

As it is Apache Kafka based, OpenTSx benefits from all of Kafka's nice features, like fault-tolerance and scalability.
