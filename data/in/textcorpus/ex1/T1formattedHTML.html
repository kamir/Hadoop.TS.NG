<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Big Data Analytics is still a
growing field which connects multiple disciplines, like statistics,
computational science, physics, and engineering. Quite often the
driving forces research projects, or business objectives which guide
to new challenges in operations research. Especially
interdisciplinary project groups have to integrate more than just
data sets. Communication and project management methods have to be
integrated into a shared workspace which allows a clear projection of
specialized views for all participating actors during all project
stages, no matter if analysis algorithms are under development or if
latest approaches are explored during first operations. Common
integrated development environments offers such functionality for
many different technologies, but usually those tools are very
specific for either engineers or scientists.    </FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1.97cm; margin-right: 2.01cm; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Because more and more data sets
and concurring analysis approaches and models are available it is
very important to track a projects life cycle and design decisions.
We propose the &quot;<I>Hadoop Distributed Metastore</I>&quot;, which
is an knowledge aggregation and exploration system. It covers and
connects two layers: (a) on the  methodological level it offers an
extendable flexible shareable long term memory functionality which
allows automatic pattern detection in user activities and (b) on the
technical level it offers pre implemented connectors to several
subsystem, especially to components present in multiple Hadoop
clusters. </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The metadata integration layer
(MIL) is able to connect multiple distributed metadata stores (DMS)
and exposes it's functionality via an explorative graph connected to
a facetted search interface. Aggregated metadata from one or many
clusters helps to find supporting information for model selection and
parameter validation based on collected descriptive data set
statistics. Our approach lowers the barriers between disciplines and
allows faster and more efficient knowledge aggregation to support
agile operations in interdisciplinary data analysis projects.</FONT></P>

Data Driven Research based on Interconnected Clusters</FONT></H1>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>In an interdisciplinary research
environment we have to cover multiple problems in one place. From
resource allocation to data management and selection of appropriate
algorithms we also need a common understanding of several aspects,
although not all participants  in the project have the same
background. This implies that for several levels of operation a
certain tool set has to be used, but the stack of tools has to be
interconnected es well. That mean, an data set or algorithm discovery
service has to combine the application level view and the operator
view. It covers technological aspects to figure out if an approach is
possible and also doable, or if it would be possible, if enough
ressource would be available. In this sense the system also collects
the demand of the users to offer information on the operators to
impro<SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">ve the system the right
way.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">B.1
Integration of Data Centers and Knowledge-Management</SPAN></FONT></H3>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">To know
everything about available data sets and applicable algorithms is
unpossible. To select an existing apporach in order to use it or to
improve requires an implementation of the software and also the
availability of that certain data set. Quite often such data sets are
not availble or it  is expensive to move data around, especially if
we have large data sets. Interconncted clusters which tell each other
what data they contain and what algorithms are implemented could
solve this problem.  </SPAN></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">In
order to manage the acces stored knowledge within such a data cloud
semantic web technologie will be used. Especially the creation of an
ontologie which describes relations between scientific disciplins,
their methods, tools and reuslts will help to create high quality
search results or even  data set discovery services. </SPAN></FONT>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">B.2
Dataset and Algorithm discover</SPAN>y</FONT></H3>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>For the beginning we work with a
webbased catalogue. This is a kind of registry that contains
descriptions of data sets and projects which are related to this data
sets. Based on simple properties one can search for data sets and
than colaboration can be initiated. The next step is a collection of
research results related to this data set or to comparable data sets.
Appropriate analysis methods which are used for a cetrain data set,
the cost and the outcome of analysis is also listed. Based in this
data and by using an ontology the preparation phase of
interdisciplinary research projects is supported as an ontology
translates the same conept to different representations either in
languages or into different scientific contexts. </FONT>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>B.3 Outlook on Cluster Optimization
Methods</FONT></H3>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>The impact of changes on the setup of a
certain cluster should be analyzed based on a reliable method. Right
now some good experience is the tool of choice but if we would
collect runtime logs of special algorithms, related to the system
setup and the data sets used for an individual computation, we would
have the input for systematic optimization tasks. Analytical as well
as numerical approaches combined with simulations offer a plenty of
new insights into running systems. This aspect is very important in
order to find optimized runtime setups for individual tasks which can
be started in different clusters. The development of real world
benchmarks, based on real computations not just dummy problems could
lead us to new horizon. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>We would than be able to analyze of the
scaling behavior related to a certain workload dependent on changed
properties of any involved component. The performance optimization
based on cluster simulations will be possible and useful, to figure
out what parameters have the important effect on performance and
cost. Such benchmark results could also be applied to select, in
which environment some analysis would be done most efficiently, or w
could learn how make a certain cluster more efficient and not to
waste resources because of non optimized configurations. Monitoring
tools already allow the collection and preparation of such runtime
performance metrics. But we have to connect this information to the
service discovery process. To use monitor data on that level can be
compared to a closed feedback loop.</FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>B.4 Goals of the Integration
Platform â Definition of Requirements</FONT></H3>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>A first conclusion so far:
contributions from multiple data locations or topic domains will lead
to multi-cluster environments while the amount of data in that
clusters grows on and because more and more until now isolated data
sets will be related to each other. Data sets will be spread over
multiple clusters, either because one cluster has not enough capacity
or if the special type of data requires local storage, e.g. based on
juristic restrictions. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>The second important aspect is: an
interdisciplinary approach needs a clear understanding of common
concepts and well configured tool chains and optimized workflows
which are not limited to single knowledge domains.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>Related to this conclusion we found two
requirements: We need two layers on top of our existing cluster
infrastructure: a) the data sets and related metadata have to be
handled efficiently and b) interdisciplinary communication has to be
enabled by connecting established tool sets to a cluster spanning
collaboration environment. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>That means system operation tools,
software development systems, and workflow engines have to interact
with each other. Based on standardized interfaces we can build and
connected data processing systems directly to knowledge management
tools as well as to operations optimization <SPAN LANG="en-US">tool
sets. </SPAN></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2>There is another reason to have
multiple clusters to be integrated into one data analysis platform.
If we have some time dependent properties and some structural
properties of a complex system represented by large data sets either
as a result of large scale simulations or even measurements, we would
have to mix two complementary access patterns during the analysis
procedure. It is quite difficult to handle this. If we want to apply
different algorithms to the same dataset with different resource
allocation, YARN will give one answer. It allows a job related
resource management to handle different requirements of different
applications more individual. But YARN does not connect clusters
directly.</FONT></P>

Graph properties are stored in Hive tables in the HDFS or HBase,
depending on the type of algorithm which will be applied later. Each
algorithm knows the data sources it can be operate on. During the
initialization phase or during the algorithm and data set discovery
phase, this context information is used to suggest relevant pre
processing steps in order to apply a certain algorithm on a data set.
If we want to calculate the degree distribution of a graph, and its
dependence on single nodes properties, there is no need for
additional libraries or frameworks. Hive, Pig an Impala allow us to
implement such analysis quit easy. If we want to apply certain
cluster detection algorithms implemented in Mahout, some knowledge on
possible data structures is needed. The procedure of fitting data to
the selected processing tool will be automatized by the HDGS as it
handles multiple synchronize representations of datasets. Such a
redundant storage is useful to speed up processing time and to lower
latency of the system. Adjacency lists, or link lists together with
node lists can be used to store graphs or networks in HBase tables or
HDFS files. This data structures are named base data set, as this

order to apply analysis steps just to some partition of an entire

single node of a cluster if we need in memory processing, e.g. based
on GPU processing capabilities, or it is spread over a certain
ensemble of cluster-nodes, in order to apply a non map reduce

partitions. The graph partition is a derived data set.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<H4 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2>D.1.3 Multiplex Networks, Temporal
Networks and k-partite Networks</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">To express a
single network, an adjacency matrix or the adjacency list is used. In
the simplest way of such an matrix all nodes are of the same type and
just the index within a node list is used to represent such a node. A
link is just a number, 0 or 1 in the simplest situation or any other
number to express a link strength as a continuos variable. A
k-partite network consists of k different types of nodes. Therefore a
certain encoding of this node property or node type is used. One way
to this to use an additional list which maps the node id of a node
with a certain type to a list of node id's used in the adjacency
matrix. In order to express multpile types of links which express
different relations between nodes, one need an n-dimensional vector,
in order to collect n different types of conections. Such a vector
would have to be identified by an id, which is used as the value
within the adjacency matrix. To maintion temporal networks we need an
additional timestamp for each link. The adjacency matrix can contain
many empty fields which are not stored if we work on an adjacency
list instead. In this case one has to maintain the following list:</SPAN></FONT></P>

	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">node

<P><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">The link list
is very important. It opens the concept of a simple adjacency matrix
to a more flexible representation of temporal networks as well as
multiplex networks an even hypergraphs, if the ordered list contains
more than two elements, otherwise the first value is used as the
source if the link and the second one as the destination.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Liberation Serif, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">We
are interested in time dependent analysis. The first step is, to
collect data in a way, that allows efficient access to the data.
Depending on the algorithm, a certain order or grouping ba a certain
property is required. Therefore the MapReduce framework is used.
Random access to special properies, especially in the context of
simulations ther the simulation algorithm just updates a certain
state of a stored value eliminates the need for holding all systems
state in memory of the compute nodes. As HBase maintains a web-scale
key value store, there all data is stored as a record with one uniqe
identifier without the need of predefined database schema it gives us
a storage for large graphs. Each change of a value in the HBase table
gets a time stamp, therfore we can maintain the history of a graph
during a simulation run. In order to do graph simulation or analysis
calculations we have to load references to the memory of the compute
nodes. Appropriate operations which can interact with the nodes
properties have to be implemented and the developer of such an
application can define its own abstraction layers on top of this
generic graph representation on top of Hbase. Many exisitng
algorithms are not able to operate on such a generic data structure
like introduced above. Therefore we have to calculate a of a
projection of such a tensor lik structure to a 2-diensional matrix,
the well known adjacency matrix. Or we would have to reimplement the
algorithms.        </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT>

the following section it is assumed to have a data storage for on
generic network implemented by an HBase server. As we want to study
properties of this certain complex system we create a
ComplexSystemRepresentation (CSR) which is defined by a set of
initial nodes. To load the state of the system at one point in time
we have to specify a certain time interval which contains this time
stamp. Now we lookup the nodes, which there created before the
beginning of this interval and also all links which are existing
within this interval. This procedure would give us a temporal
network. If we are intersted in an aggregated network we select the
appropriate start time of the interval. The first step is to merge
all properties of a single onject like a node or a link. That means
during time, such properties can change. We have to define, how such
properties shoulf have to be mapped to our final network view. One
way is to aggrgate the data. Another way would be to calculate
average values. A result of this procedure is a list of nodes and a
list of links with the time stamp which is exactly in the middle of
complete interval. From time series we go to just one value at one
point in time. Time dependent analysis ist done by repeating this
provedure multiple times for a sliding time frame. </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Liberation Serif, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">The
best way to process such generic data structure depends in the
analysis algorihm. In order to do simulations and analysis in one
place, an efficient intermediate data representation on top of an
distibuted storage an processing layer is a key issue. We have to
define generic projections for several types of views but the core
idea is, that such view are use-case specific but the applied
operations are quite often just simple aggregations, filter or
grouping. And again the MapReduce framework solves such tasks best.
HDFS files are not a good representation for a realy large time
dependent graph because we need random access to certain values.
HBase allows to store the data in the needed way but we need a higher
level abstraction of a generic graph as a generic system which is not
just a set of data but also has a certain way how relations and

Properties of Dynamic Networks</FONT></H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Liberation Serif, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In
order to have a dynamic network representation we use time dependent
node and link properties. This leads to a time series for each single
property which could be analyzed later, as the dynamic of structural
properties is quite often relevant to certain analytical question.
Sometimes we have to handle multiple snapshots of the entire, one
adjacency matrix or list for each time step. In this case we use a
derived dataset to connect the procedure of preparation or
aggregation method to the raw data set and to the intermediate
results. Such a procedure can be just filtering, averaging, or even a
quite comprehensive structure analysis or a even a correlation
analysis. Such algorithms are able to derive new graph
representations based on given data set and the results lead to new
time series data which for itself can be handled as a base data set
again. The concept of storing the processing context of derived data
sets is an important aspect of the scientific method and it allows
the implementation of a semantic toolkit for data set and algorithm
detection as well. The responsibility of the HDGS impelentation is to
provide a set of data types and data mappers as well a some reference
implementions for a complete analysis-scenario like it is shon figure
3. All green circles in  this figure are data structures which will
be stored eihther in HDFS or in Hbase. We define mapper to convert
different inter mediate data types from one to each other as well as
data import and export connectors to external systems. The
environment for such an integration is shown in figure 4. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Liberation Serif, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
proposed âIntegrated Multi Scale Multi Model Simulation and
Analysisâ system offers  modularity and integration in one place.
Such a simulation approach changes the idea of computer based
simulation as it opens the simulation scenario to multiple
implementations of simulation algorithms and model variants. Instead
of one fixed model, which is used to calculate one result for one set
of initial data, we have now an open system to simulate a complex
system by an iterative approach. We can add new aspects, and redo
relevant steps and evaluate changes directly. The change of
algorithms or parameters can be in the focus of optimization studies.
While we are looking on the impact of some special changes in the
simulation setup it is also possible to change reference data by
multiple external public data sets and redo the simulation procedure
to study the impact of data sources and data quality on our
simulation results.  </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Finally application developers can access datasets
without any need on handling large datasets. Research projects would
have major advantages, as the setup of an analysis task would be done
in a short time instead of a many weeks long project, just to prepare
the analysis setup. This approach would lower the barriers of
interdisciplinary and inter institutional projects significantly.

<H1 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4><I><B>Outlook</B></I></FONT></H1>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Webservices are offered and used for many years.
Different technologies are competing and many integration patterns
are known to interact with web services in a distributed
heterogeneous application environment. Flexibility in the system
architecture based on loose coupling of components is a key feature
in the service oriented world of SOA applications. Lets assume we
want to do some analysis on a large data set which is already stored
in the cloud. But as our approach is quite innovative there is no web
service implementing our preferred method. We would have to setup our
own storage and processing cluster and then we would have to import
the dataset. Than hadoop distributes the calculation to the place
there data is stored. The same idea should be transferred to a multi
cluster environment in which subsystems communicate via web service
infrastructure. Therefore each cluster would offer some of the core
functionality via simple web services. Enterprise integration
patterns are now used to connect processing clusters and interact
with them.  
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Dataset discovery services are offered by the
Context &amp; Discovery Service Component. Therefore this Subsystem
uses the Webservice offered by the Cloud Data Service Directory and
Cloud Dataset Directory. Beside such directories web search engines
and semantic web tools based on RDFs and special ontologies will be
used to find relevant datasets which are not yet published in such a
standardized way until now. Companies, data service providers and
research institutions will provide individual instances of Linked
Data Cloud Masters (green box in figure 2) in their data centers.
Clusters can be connected to each other by an <B>n : m</B> relation
in this way. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>On an abstract level those services are simple web
services, but what they do is something new. We can automatically
detect the location of certain datasets and related processing
capabilities together with information about operating conditions.
Based on the well known Hadoop infrastructure it would be easy to
submit queries, scripts or even map reduce code by a web service call
to a remote cluster. Instead of moving data from one data center or
laboratory to another we would just move programs and collect the
results. Tools like Hive, Pig, HCatalog and Oozie will be the
building blocks of such an integration layer on top of the core
Hadoop System which stores data in HDFS or HBase.
